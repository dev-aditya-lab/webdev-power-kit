## 🛠 Tips for Developers

If you're planning to contribute code:

* Follow the **modular structure**: each feature in its own folder with `index.ts`
* Use **TypeScript** and include **error handling**
* Add **JSDoc comments**
* Keep it framework-agnostic (React examples only in docs)

📦 All exported files should go through `/src/` and use clear file names.
